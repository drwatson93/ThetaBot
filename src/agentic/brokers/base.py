"""The broker-agnostic execution interface.

Every venue (Robinhood MCP, robin_stocks, Alpaca, paper) implements ``ExecutionBroker``.
The rest of the app depends only on this interface, so the "which broker / does RH
support options yet" question is fully contained here. ``capabilities()`` reports
whether the broker can place option orders — the factory probes this at startup.
