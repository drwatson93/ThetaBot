"""Read-only performance analytics for the dashboard.

Pure functions over domain objects (positions, orders, decisions) — no DB or I/O — so they
are trivially testable. P&L covers SHORT premium only (the only thing this platform trades):
a short collects ``credit_received`` per share at open (×100 per contract); closing it pays a
debit per share. Win/loss is realized only.

Outcome rules:
  * OPEN / CLOSING  -> "open"      (unrealized P&L from current_mark if known)
  * EXPIRED         -> "win"       (short expired worthless -> keep the full credit)
  * CLOSED + fill   -> "win"/"loss" by realized P&L = (credit - close_debit) ×100 ×qty
  * CLOSED, no fill -> "win"/"loss" ESTIMATED from the last mark (``pnl_estimated=True``) when a
                       mark is known — e.g. a reconcile-detected close whose buy-to-close order
                       state lagged at the broker; only "closed" (unknown) if no mark either
  * ASSIGNED        -> "assigned"  (P&L depends on share disposition; excluded)

Fees are NOT included in v1 — broker fee fields aren't persisted yet (see robinhood_mcp
review payload's ``fees`` block for the data we'd wire in later).
