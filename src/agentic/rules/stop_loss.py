"""Stop-loss rule for short premium — cap a losing position / avoid deep assignment.

Two independent triggers (either fires a close, whichever hits first):

  * ``loss_mult``: cost-to-close has risen to N× the credit received (e.g. 2.0 = the option now
    costs twice what we sold it for, i.e. ~-100% of credit).
  * ``delta_stop``: the option's |delta| has crossed a threshold (e.g. 0.50) — the strike is being
    breached and assignment risk is climbing.

Stateless. For the wheel, assignment is acceptable, so this is a deliberate opt-in defense against
a name that "keeps going down". Cost-to-close is the bid/ask midpoint so a momentary wide ask
cannot trip the stop. The close order itself is a limit that starts at mid.

A trigger whose param is null is off and does not fire; the other trigger still does. 0 is not
"off" (it would trip immediately) and the settings API rejects it. An enabled rule with both
triggers null never fires here. The dashboard rejects that combination and asks the owner to
disable the rule instead.
