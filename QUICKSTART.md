# ThetaBot — Quickstart

The 5-minute version. Full detail: **[README.md](./README.md)**. Setting up with an AI assistant? Point it at **[AGENTS.md](./AGENTS.md)**.

> ⚠️ This trades **real money** and can result in being assigned shares. Start in **paper mode**, use money you can afford to lose, and read the README's warnings. Not financial advice.

## Before you start
- A **Robinhood** account with **options enabled** + **agentic access** (set up in the Robinhood app).
- ~$5/mo for a small VPS.

## 1. Get your Robinhood token (on your computer, once)
```bash
python -m agentic.tools.rh_login      # opens a browser + pairs with your phone
```
Creates `data/rh_oauth.json`. Keep it secret — never commit or share it.

## 2. Get a server
Create a VPS (Hostinger — **https://www.hostinger.com?REFERRALCODE=LRBKTHIELNOA**), choose **Ubuntu**, and paste this into the **"Post-install script"** field so it installs automatically:
```
#!/bin/bash
curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/drwatson93/ThetaBot/main/scripts/bootstrap.sh | bash
```
(Or SSH in later and run that one line yourself.)

## 3. Configure
```bash
nano ~/ThetaBot/.env           # set DASHBOARD_PASSWORD (and CONTROL_TOKEN)
nano ~/ThetaBot/config.yaml     # your watchlist; leave mode: paper for now
```
Upload your token from your computer:
```bash
scp data/rh_oauth.json root@YOUR_VPS_IP:~/ThetaBot/data/
```

## 4. Start (paper mode)
```bash
cd ~/ThetaBot && docker compose up -d --build
```

## 5. View the dashboard (no website needed)
```bash
ssh -L 8000:localhost:8000 root@YOUR_VPS_IP     # then open http://localhost:8000
```
Want a secure always-on URL instead? See **README → Accessing your dashboard securely** (Cloudflare Tunnel).

## 6. Go live — only when you're ready
Set **both** `mode: live` and `i_understand_live_trading: true` in `config.yaml`, then `docker compose up -d`. Start with a **small** account and a **short** watchlist. The dashboard is read-only; edit the yaml (not the UI) to change limits.
