# ThetaBot

**An autonomous options-*wheel* bot that runs entirely off your own Robinhood account — one login, one small server, no paid data feeds.**

It sells cash-secured puts on stocks you'd be happy to own, manages them to a profit target, and — if assigned — sells covered calls against the shares. The same disciplined rules every day, with no emotion. This is the **community edition**: all market data comes from the *same* Robinhood connection it trades through, so you don't need an Alpaca subscription, a TradingView Pro plan, or anything else.

---

> ## ⚠️ Read this before anything else
>
> - **This bot places real trades with real money.** There is no "demo money" once it's armed live.
> - **Selling puts means you can be assigned** — i.e. *forced to buy 100 shares per contract* at the strike. Only ever put names on your watchlist that you are genuinely willing to own, in sizes you can afford.
> - **Options carry real, sometimes total, loss risk**, including sharp overnight/gap losses. A wheel is *not* a guaranteed-income machine.
> - **This is not financial advice**, not a solicitation, and comes with **no warranty of any kind**. You run it entirely at your own risk.
> - **Not affiliated with, endorsed by, or supported by Robinhood.** It uses Robinhood's agentic connection; you are responsible for complying with Robinhood's Terms of Service. Robinhood can change or revoke that access at any time.
> - **Start in paper mode. Start tiny. Watch it for weeks before you trust it.**
>
> If you are not comfortable reading logs, using SSH, and losing every dollar in the account, **do not run this.**

## What it does

The **options wheel**, automated end to end:

1. **Sell a cash-secured put** on a watchlist name — collect a premium for agreeing to buy the stock at a lower ("strike") price.
2. **If it expires worthless** (stock stayed above the strike) → keep the premium, repeat.
3. **If you're assigned** (stock fell below the strike) → you now own 100 shares per contract at that strike.
4. **Sell covered calls** against those shares — collect more premium — until the shares are called away at/above your cost basis. Then back to step 1.

Every scan, the bot screens each watchlist name's live option chain, filters for the right delta / days-to-expiry / liquidity / yield, ranks by how *rich* the premium is (IV rank), sizes the position so no single bet dominates, and places the order. It then monitors open positions and buys them back at a profit target, rolls when it makes sense, or lets them ride to assignment.

It is deliberately a **slow, patient** strategy: 7–14 day expirations, held for days, only on names you'd own.

## How it works

| Component | Job |
|---|---|
| **Scanner** | Every few minutes during market hours: screen the watchlist, rank candidates, size, and open new CSPs / CCs. |
| **Monitor** | Continuously price open positions; take profit, alert on short-DTE, track excursions. |
| **Executor** | Places and confirms orders through Robinhood; never leaves an order in an unknown state. |
| **Reconcile** | Keeps the bot's ledger in sync with what Robinhood actually reports (assignments, expiries, fills). |
| **Risk** | Position/sizing caps, entry gates, a **loss circuit breaker**, and an instant kill switch. |
| **Dashboard** | A password-protected, phone-first web page: health, positions, weekly **and** all-time P&L, the "why" behind every decision, a daily **Setups** read with measured edge and per-name risk profiles, a **Weekly tactical brief** archive, and a **Tuning** tab to change config live from your phone. |

All of it runs as **one small Docker container** that keeps its state (a local SQLite database + your login token) on a persistent volume. Market data — option chains, quotes, greeks, IV, open interest, and daily price bars — is pulled from **Robinhood's own connection** (`market_data.provider: robinhood`), so there are **no separate data subscriptions**.

## What you need

- **A Robinhood account** with **options trading enabled** and **agentic access** set up (a primary account + the agentic sub-account — see Step 1). Level 2+ options approval is required to sell cash-secured puts.
- **A VPS** to run it 24/7. This guide uses **Hostinger** (Step 2). The bot is lightweight — the smallest KVM plan is plenty.
- **A desktop computer** for the one-time Robinhood login (the login flow needs a browser + your phone).
- Basic comfort with **SSH and the command line**.
- **~30–45 minutes** for first-time setup.

You do **not** need: an Alpaca account, a TradingView subscription, a paid market-data feed, or any cloud provider beyond the VPS.

## Setup overview

```
Desktop:   run the one-time Robinhood login  →  produces data/rh_oauth.json
Hostinger: create a VPS (Ubuntu) → install Docker
VPS:       clone this repo → add your secrets + config → upload rh_oauth.json → docker compose up
Browser:   open the dashboard → verify health → (when ready) arm live
```

---

## Step 1 — Robinhood account + one-time login

1. **Have a Robinhood account with options enabled.** You need approval to sell cash-secured puts (typically options Level 2). Set this up in the Robinhood app first.
2. **Enable agentic access.** Robinhood's automated ("agentic") trading uses a dedicated connection. Follow Robinhood's in-app flow to enable it and create the agentic sub-account you want the bot to trade. **Only that account trades** — the bot cannot place orders on your other accounts.
3. **Run the one-time login on your desktop** (not the VPS — the flow opens a browser and pairs with your phone):

   ```bash
   # on your desktop, with this repo cloned and Python 3.13 + deps installed:
   pip install -e ".[all]"
   python -m agentic.tools.rh_login
   ```

   This walks through Robinhood's OAuth flow and writes **`data/rh_oauth.json`** (your access + refresh tokens). You'll upload that file to the VPS in Step 3. The bot **auto-refreshes** the token from then on — you won't have to log in again unless the refresh chain is broken.

> **Guard `rh_oauth.json` like a password.** It authorizes trading on your account. Never commit it, never share it, never paste it anywhere. It is git-ignored by default.

---

## Step 2 — Spin up a Hostinger VPS

> 💡 **Get a Hostinger VPS here → https://www.hostinger.com?REFERRALCODE=LRBKTHIELNOA** — using this link supports the project at no extra cost to you.
>
> ⚡ **Skip the manual install:** when creating the VPS, paste this into Hostinger's **"Post-install script"** field and the server boots with Docker + ThetaBot already set up:
>
> ```
> #!/bin/bash
> curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/drwatson93/ThetaBot/main/scripts/bootstrap.sh | bash
> ```
> *(Requires the repo to be public. Then just SSH in, edit `.env` + `config.yaml`, upload your token, and start it.)*

1. Go to Hostinger → **VPS Hosting** and choose a plan. **KVM 1** (1 vCPU / 4 GB RAM / ~50 GB) is more than enough — the bot uses a tiny fraction of it. KVM 2 gives comfortable headroom if you want it.
2. **Operating system:** choose **Ubuntu 24.04** (or 22.04). If Hostinger offers an **"Ubuntu with Docker"** template, pick it — Docker comes pre-installed and you can skip part of Step 3.
3. Set a strong **root password** (or, better, add your **SSH key**) when prompted.
4. Choose a **datacenter** near you (or near US markets — latency isn't critical for this slow strategy).
5. Once it provisions, note the VPS's **public IP address** from the Hostinger control panel (hPanel → VPS → your server).
6. **SSH in** from your desktop:

   ```bash
   ssh root@YOUR_VPS_IP
   ```

## Host on Render (paper practice week)

For a one-week **paper** soak with real Robinhood quotes and **simulated** fills (no real orders):

1. On your **desktop**, run the one-time login (see Step 1) and copy the one-line `RH_OAUTH_JSON` it prints.
2. Copy `config.render.example.yaml` into a Render **Secret File** named `config.yaml`. Fill `entry.watchlist` with names you are willing to own, and set `paper_buying_power` to your real account size. Keep `mode: paper`.
3. In Render: **New → Blueprint**, point it at [drwatson93/ThetaBot](https://github.com/drwatson93/ThetaBot), apply `render.yaml`. Paste `RH_OAUTH_JSON` when prompted. Copy `DASHBOARD_PASSWORD` from the Environment tab after create. Optionally set `PAUSE_TOKEN` (Environment → add, a long random string *different* from `CONTROL_TOKEN`) so a monitoring bot can pause via `POST /control/pause-only` without getting the resume/approval secret.
4. Open `https://<service>.onrender.com/health`. You want `"mode":"paper"`, `"live_armed":false`, `"robinhood_connected":true`, `"practice":true`. If `robinhood_connected` is false, the scanner has no real chains — re-check the token.
5. Leave `mode: live` and `i_understand_live_trading` **off** for the whole practice week.

The Blueprint uses one Starter web service, Virginia, a 1 GB disk at `/app/data` (required: the OAuth refresh token is rewritten on every use), and auto-deploy **off**. Free Render instances will not work (no disk, they sleep after 15 minutes).

To replace a broken token later: run `rh_login` on the desktop again, paste the new JSON into `RH_OAUTH_JSON`, set `RH_OAUTH_RESEED=1` for one deploy, then turn that flag off.

## Step 3 — Install & deploy

> ### ⚡ Fastest path — one command
> On a fresh Ubuntu VPS (or if you used the Hostinger post-install script above, this is already done):
> ```bash
> curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/drwatson93/ThetaBot/main/scripts/bootstrap.sh | bash
> ```
> That installs Docker, clones ThetaBot, and creates your `.env` + `config.yaml`. Then jump to editing them below (steps 3 & 5) — you can skip the manual Docker install and clone.

Manual steps (or to understand what the script did):
On the VPS:

1. **Install Docker** (skip if your template already has it):

   ```bash
   curl -fsSL https://get.docker.com | sh
   docker --version   # confirm it's installed
   ```

2. **Clone this repo** and enter it:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/drwatson93/ThetaBot.git
   cd ThetaBot
   ```

3. **Create your secrets file** from the template:

   ```bash
   cp .env.example .env
   nano .env
   ```

   Fill in — at minimum:

   ```ini
   # Dashboard login (pick your own — you'll use these to open the web UI)
   DASHBOARD_USER=admin
   DASHBOARD_PASSWORD=change-this-to-something-strong

   # A random token that protects the control endpoints (pause/resume/etc.)
   # Never give this to a monitoring bot — it also derives one-tap approval tokens.
   CONTROL_TOKEN=another-long-random-string

   # Optional. Pause-only token for a monitoring bot (cannot resume or approve).
   PAUSE_TOKEN=

   # (Optional) desktop push alerts via Pushover — leave blank to skip
   PUSHOVER_TOKEN=
   PUSHOVER_USER=

   # (Optional) AI trade-review commentary via Claude — leave blank to skip
   ANTHROPIC_API_KEY=
   ```

   You do **not** set any Alpaca or TradingView keys in this edition.

4. **Upload your Robinhood token.** The easy path is a bind-mounted `data/` folder. Create it and copy the file you made in Step 1:

   ```bash
   mkdir -p data
   # from your DESKTOP, in a separate terminal:
   scp data/rh_oauth.json root@YOUR_VPS_IP:/root/ThetaBot/data/rh_oauth.json
   ```

   Then make sure `docker-compose.yml` mounts your host `data/` folder (this edition ships that way):

   ```yaml
   volumes:
     - ./data:/app/data
   ```

5. **Set your strategy config:**

   ```bash
   cp config.example.yaml config.yaml
   nano config.yaml
   ```

   The most important line to check first:

   ```yaml
   mode: paper          # START HERE. Change to "live" only when you're ready.
   entry:
     enabled: true
     watchlist: [F, SOFI, ...]     # names you are happy to own
   market_data: robinhood          # default: all data from your Robinhood login (no Alpaca)
   ```

   (Full options in the [Configuration reference](#configuration-reference).)

6. **Launch:**

   ```bash
   docker compose up -d --build
   docker compose logs -f          # watch it boot; Ctrl-C to stop watching
   ```

## Step 4 — First run, paper → live

1. **Open the dashboard via SSH tunnel** (port 8000 is bound to localhost only): `ssh -L 8000:localhost:8000 user@YOUR_VPS` then `http://localhost:8000` — log in with the `DASHBOARD_USER` / `DASHBOARD_PASSWORD` you set.
2. **Confirm health:** the top banner should show the broker connected and *not degraded*. Check `http://localhost:8000/health` returns `ok`.
3. **Let it run in paper mode for a while.** Watch it screen, "trade," and manage positions with no real money. Read the decision log — make sure its choices make sense to *you*.
4. **Add HTTPS (recommended before going live).** Exposing a password over plain `http://` is risky. The simplest option is to put **Caddy** in front for automatic HTTPS with a domain you point at the VPS — see the wiki/`docs/`. At minimum, restrict port 8000 with a firewall to your own IP.
5. **Go live only when you're ready:** set **both** `mode: live` **and** `i_understand_live_trading: true` in `config.yaml`, start with a **small** account and a **short** watchlist, then `docker compose up -d` to apply. The dashboard will show `live_armed: true`. Leaving the second flag false keeps the bot read-only even if `mode` says live.

## Accessing your dashboard securely

The dashboard runs on your server at port **8000**. **You do not need a domain or a website.** Pick the access method that fits — simplest to most polished:

### 1. Direct IP — not the default
Port 8000 is bound to `127.0.0.1` only. `http://YOUR_VPS_IP:8000` will not work unless you deliberately republish the port. Prefer the SSH tunnel or Cloudflare Tunnel below.

### 2. SSH tunnel — recommended default (nothing exposed, free)
Nothing to install, no open ports. From your computer:
```bash
ssh -L 8000:localhost:8000 root@YOUR_VPS_IP
```
Then open `http://localhost:8000` while that SSH session is running. The dashboard is never reachable from the public internet — the most private option, and it costs nothing.

### 3. Cloudflare Tunnel — best for always-on access (HTTPS, no open ports) ✅ packaged
A persistent, encrypted URL you can hit from anywhere (including your phone), with **no inbound ports open on your VPS**. It's built in — just enable it:
1. At **dash.cloudflare.com → Zero Trust → Networks → Tunnels → Create a tunnel** (free).
2. Add a **public hostname** (a subdomain on a domain you've added to Cloudflare) and route it to the service **`http://agentic:8000`**.
3. Put the tunnel **token** in `.env`:  `CLOUDFLARE_TUNNEL_TOKEN=...`
4. Start with the tunnel profile:
   ```bash
   docker compose --profile tunnel up -d
   ```
Now it's at `https://yourname.example.com`, port 8000 still closed to the world. For a real login wall, add a **Cloudflare Access** policy (email/Google) to that hostname — highly recommended.

### 4. Your own domain + HTTPS (Caddy)
Prefer to self-host HTTPS like a classic web app? Point a domain at the VPS and run Caddy in front for automatic Let's Encrypt certs. More moving parts than the tunnel; only if you specifically want it.

**Bottom line:** most people should use the **SSH tunnel** for occasional checks, or a **Cloudflare Tunnel** for a secure always-on URL. A public website is optional.

```

### Exit rules from the dashboard

The owner login can tune exit rules on the dashboard **Rules** tab. The view-only login sees the same numbers and cannot save (the server returns 403). Each rule has an on/off switch. The number fields are:

| Field | Rule | Allowed |
|---|---|---|
| `profit_pct` | profit target | 0.05–0.95 |
| `loss_mult` | stop loss | 1.0–10, or off |
| `delta_stop` | stop loss | 0.1–1.0, or off |
| `dte_threshold` | DTE close | whole number 0–30 |

**Stop-loss triggers.** `null` means that trigger is off. `0` is not off (it would trip immediately) and is rejected. Turning off `loss_mult` leaves `delta_stop` active, and the other way around. Turning **both** triggers off while the rule stays enabled is rejected — disable the rule itself (`enabled: false`) to turn stop-loss off. You can turn the rule back on later and set either trigger again.

Saving posts the full rules list plus the signature of the rules the form was loaded from. The page shows old → new and locks the inputs until you confirm or cancel. On confirm it reads the form again and refuses to post if that differs from the diff you reviewed. The list must be the same rules that are already running: same names, same `rule_type`, same order. Adding, removing, or retyping a rule is rejected and nothing is changed. If another save landed first, the server returns 409, changes nothing, and the page tells you to reload. Other fields (`requires_approval`, `action`, `match`, trailing) stay as they are. `match` is display-only: a TradingView alert always tries an exact contract, then the underlying.

A successful save that actually changes a value is applied in place, written to the data-disk overlay (it overrides `config.yaml`), and recorded as a `CONFIG_EDIT` audit row. Changed fields are stored as `rules.<name>.<field>: {old, new}` — for example `rules.stop-loss.params.loss_mult` from `2.0` to `null`. A save whose leaf diff is empty writes no `CONFIG_EDIT` row, so a no-op does not ping Watchman. Every real change still does.

The monitor reloads exit rules on its next poll. A disabled profit-target, stop-loss, or DTE rule is not evaluated. Turning **tv-signal** off is read live by the signal processor: it does not match, does not open a close decision, and does not call the executor or the approval gate. Alerts that arrive while it is off are expired, so turning it back on does not replay them. Alerts that arrive after it is on still close. Mode, live-arming, broker, and the hard-coded real-order lock are not on this screen.

Tune the yield floor and delta band to your own risk tolerance. Higher `min_annualized_yield` = fewer, richer, higher-IV trades; lower = more, thinner ones. The defaults above are the ones that survived a real-option-print backtest under both fair and worst-case fills; **[docs/backtests.md](docs/backtests.md)** lists every lever tested, what held up, and what did not.

## Optional integrations (for different setups)

**By default, ThetaBot needs nothing but your Robinhood login** — market data and trading both ride the same connection. But if you already pay for better data or extra signals, you can plug them in. Neither is required.

### Option A — Alpaca for market data

Robinhood's data is complete and works well for this slow strategy, but you can use **Alpaca** instead (e.g. you already have it, or want a separate data source):

1. Create an account at **[alpaca.markets](https://alpaca.markets)** and generate API keys.
2. **Real-time options data (OPRA) requires Alpaca's *paid* market-data subscription.** The free tier is delayed ("indicative") and is **not safe for live entry** — only use it for paper testing. Subscribe to their options/Algo data plan for live trading.
3. Add the keys to `.env`:
   ```ini
   ALPACA_API_KEY=your_key
   ALPACA_API_SECRET=your_secret
   ```
4. Switch the provider (and feed) in `config.yaml`:
   ```yaml
   market_data: alpaca
   entry:
     feed: opra        # real-time (paid). Use "indicative" only for paper/testing.
   ```
5. `docker compose up -d` to apply. Everything else is identical.

### Option B — TradingView for extra trend signals

ThetaBot can *optionally* gate entries on **ADX** (trend strength) and **Bollinger %B** (position in the band), fed from TradingView alerts. This is **pure enrichment — the bot runs fine without it**, and these gates are **off by default**.

Requires a **TradingView plan that supports webhook alerts** (Pro+ or higher).

1. Choose a webhook token and add it to `.env`:
   ```ini
   TRADINGVIEW_WEBHOOK_TOKEN=some_long_random_string
   ```
2. In TradingView, create alerts on your watchlist symbols with the **Webhook URL**:
   ```
   https://YOUR_HOST/webhook/tradingview?token=some_long_random_string
   ```
   and an alert message that posts the indicator values as JSON (the symbol plus its `adx` and `bb_percent_b`). The webhook handler at `POST /webhook/tradingview` ingests those into each name's context.
3. Turn the gates on in `config.yaml`:
   ```yaml
   entry:
     criteria:
       min_adx: 20            # skip weak / choppy trends
       min_bb_percent_b: 20   # skip price pinned to the lower band
   ```

If no fresh alert has arrived for a symbol, these gates simply **don't apply** (fail-open) — they never block a trade for lack of data. To turn them back off, remove the two lines (or set them to `null`).

## Operating the bot

- **Dashboard** (`/`) -- tabbed and mobile-friendly:
  - **Overview:** health, open positions, realized/unrealized P&L (this week **and** all-time), win rate, the reason behind each close, the **gains-sweep reserve** (held, swept to date, this week's net, next sweep) and **Ready to add** (tier names the account can now afford).
  - **Watchlist:** the daily read on every name you watch. **Setups today** labels each name from completed daily bars -- *washout* (oversold), *quiet base*, *support test*, *coiling* (volatility squeeze), *breakout* / *breakdown* (confirmed on volume) -- plus a **live** column for today's unfinished bar breaking a range or support right now. Labels carry a put-seller bias (favorable / avoid / neutral). Below it, **Which setups have edge here** scores every fire on what actually happened 5 and 10 bars later on *your* names (hit rate, average move, worst 10-day dip), and **Per-name risk profile** measures, for each name, how often a put a given expected-move cushion below spot was touched or finished in the money over the last year, and suggests a wider cushion for names that run hot. Every watchlist add is profiled automatically. Endpoints: `/api/setups`, `/api/setups/accuracy`, `/api/risk-profile`.
  - **Brief:** the **Weekly tactical brief** (`/api/brief`) -- market backdrop, this week's catalysts, setups firing, per-name expected-move **cushion** (strike distance in option-implied moves), earnings-inside-the-contract flags, open-position **management** (roll window / moneyness), and **assignment capacity** (collateral if every short put were assigned vs. buying power). Every generated brief is **saved**: the tab opens on the latest one, a picker lists earlier ones (`/api/briefs`, `/api/briefs/{id}`), and **Generate new** builds a fresh one. Descriptive only -- not advice.
  - **Tuning:** change config **live from your phone** -- no SSH, no restart. Multi-CSP cap, the entry gates, the **market regime** block (confirmed-downtrend skip), the **gains sweep** (on/off, percent, symbol, day/time, dry run), **setup gates** (`avoid_setups` / `require_setups`, a *prefer setups* ranking tilt, a one-tap *put-seller preset* that avoids the breakout family, and *apply suggested cushions* from the risk profile), the delta band, and per-ticker overrides, each schema-validated and persisted to a writable overlay (safety-critical keys stay locked). All setup gates are **off by default** and only ever tighten.
  - **On a phone** the tabs sit in a bottom bar within thumb reach, every card folds on a tap (remembered per device), and wide tables keep their first column pinned while you scroll sideways.
- **Gains sweep / tax reserve** (`tax_reserve`, off by default): every week at the time you set, the bot takes a share of that week's **net** realized gains (losses carry forward, so a red week is netted against the next green one) and buys that many dollars of a symbol you choose with a small regular-hours market order -- **SGOV** (T-bills) to set money aside for taxes, or an index fund to reinvest premium. The holding is **walled off**: it never counts as trading capital, is never written against, and the bot never sells it. One ledger row per week (`GET /api/tax-reserve`), so a restart can't double-buy. Run it with `dry_run: true` for a cycle first; the ledger shows what it *would* have bought.
- **Ready to add** (`entry.watchlist_tiers`, optional): list quality names with the collateral one contract needs; once the account can hold one under the per-name cap, they show up on the Overview and Tuning tabs with a one-tap **Add** that carries their `per_ticker` overrides. The bot never adds names on its own (`GET /api/tiers`).
- **Assignment clock** (`cc_below_basis_after_days`, opt-in, per ticker): by default calls are never sold below cost basis, which on volatile names can park capital for months. With a clock set, shares still under water that many days after assignment may be written against below basis inside a 5-10% OTM band, so the capital turns over. The holdings table shows each name's days held and whether below-basis calls are allowed.
- **Open interest:** `GET /api/option-oi?symbol=SMR` returns the full call+put chain with OI, volume, IV and greeks (Robinhood-sourced; Alpaca's snapshots carry no OI).
- **Pause / resume:** the kill switch halts *all* new orders instantly; use it any time you want to stop trading without touching positions. Resume needs the dashboard login plus `CONTROL_TOKEN`. A monitoring bot can pause (only) with `POST /control/pause-only?token=$PAUSE_TOKEN&reason=...` — that token cannot resume or approve trades.
- **Loss circuit breaker:** trips automatically on a losing streak (see below) and shows in `/api/ops` — it freezes *new* entries but keeps managing what's open.
- **Logs:** `docker compose logs -f` on the VPS.
- **Updating:** `git pull && docker compose up -d --build`.
- **Backups:** your whole state is `data/` (the SQLite DB + `rh_oauth.json`). Back that folder up.

## Safety & risk controls

The bot is built to *survive*, not to gamble:

- **Only sells names you list** — you curate the universe of what it can be assigned.
- **Position + concentration caps** so no single trade dominates.
- **Entry gates** — skips earnings, broken downtrends, illiquid contracts, and (opt-in) thin cushion or thin variance-risk-premium (the expected-move and IV/realized gates). An opt-in **confirmed-downtrend skip** pauses new puts market-wide once SPY has spent five straight sessions under its 200-day.
- **Roll safety** — a roll that closes the old put but cannot open the new one is audited as an error and pushed to you as "Roll INCOMPLETE", never silently dropped.
- **Loss circuit breaker** — freezes new entries after a bad realized run (default: −10% of account in 7 days, or 4 straight losers). It **never force-liquidates** — it stops digging, it doesn't panic-sell.
- **Instant kill switch** — halts on broker errors or on your command.
- **No hidden leverage** — cash-secured puts are fully collateralized.

None of this removes market risk. A sharp gap down on a held name is still a real loss.

## Troubleshooting

| Symptom | Check |
|---|---|
| Dashboard won't load | `docker compose ps` (is it running?), firewall allows port 8000, correct IP. |
| Banner shows "degraded"/broker down | `rh_oauth.json` present in `data/`? Token still valid? Re-run `rh_login` on desktop and re-upload. |
| No trades firing | Normal if nothing clears your criteria. Lower `min_annualized_yield` or check the decision log for the gate that's rejecting. |
| "paused" and won't trade | Kill switch or loss breaker engaged — check `/api/ops` for the reason; resume from the dashboard. |
| Token stopped refreshing | Re-run the desktop `rh_login` and re-upload `rh_oauth.json`. |
